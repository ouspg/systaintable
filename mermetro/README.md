# Mermetro

Mermetro is a tool made for visual representation of data from OUSPG Classifier https://github.com/ouspg/systaintable/tree/main/classifier output using **Mermaid**

The Python script processes .json files generated by the Classifier:
* It creates tuples from entries that share the same "line": "value".
* If tuple A and tuple B share a common entry, they are merged to form a group.
* This grouping is repeated until all possible merges are done.


## Project tree

```
mermetro/
├── mermetro.py            # Main Python script
├── common_values.txt      # List of common values (e.g., DNS servers) to avoid unnecessary grouping
├── templates/
│   ├── sivusto.html       # HTML template for the visualization frontend
└── static/
    ├── favicon.ico        # Site icon
```

## Usage

 Place the `.json` file exported from the Classifier into the `mermetro` directory (where `mermetro.py` is located)

Run `mermetro.py`, follow the prints and wait, it can take several minutes to complete with larger files
